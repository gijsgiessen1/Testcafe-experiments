This small program tests the Convenant Generator of Zorgeloosch at:

 https://convenant-generator.zorgeloosch.nl

You run it with node with the command: node Init.js


For obvious reasons, the log-in information is not included. If an authorized user wants to use this mini-program the user should make their own log-in user Role. As you can see, the login.js file uses the useRole 'adminLogin'. This role has been omitted from this project on github.
